        description: |
          This represents the number of months between the customer's first and last transaction with us

      - name: total_spending

        description: |
          This represents the average amount of money the customer spends each month.

          This is calculated by looking at the amount of money spent by the customer and dividing it by the number of months between their first and last transaction with us

      - name: average_transactions_per_month
        description: |
          This represents the average number of transactions the customer carries out each month.

      - name: customer_spending_category
        description: |
          This represents the spending category the customer has been allocated to.

          This can take the values: 'High', 'Medium', 'Low', 'No Segment', where 'No Segment' refers to a customer who has only made a single order with us.

          This allocation is as follows:
            - First we calculate the total amount of money this customer has spent with us
            - Then we calculate the amount of time between their first and last order with us and divide their total expenditure by this, giving us an average spend per unit time
            - Lastly, analysis of the distibution of average spend per unit time is carried out, and from there the customer is allocated into a segment accordingly.
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['High', 'Medium', 'Low', 'No Segment']

      - name: customer_purchase_frequency_category
        description: |
          This represents the purchase frequency category the customer has been allocated to.

          This can take the values: 'Frequent', 'Occasional', 'Rare', 'No Segment', where 'No Segment' refers to a customer who has only made a single order with us.

          This allocation is as follows:
            - First we calculate the total number of orders this customer has had with us
            - Then we calculate the amount of time between their first and last order with us and divide their total orders by this, giving us average number of orders per unit time
            - Lastly, analysis of the distibution of average number of orders per unit time is carried out, and from there the customer is allocated into a segment accordingly.
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['Frequent', 'Occasional', 'Rare', 'No Segment']

      - name: customer_product_diversity_category
        description: |
          This represents the product diversity category (i.e. number of different products ordered) the customer has been allocated to.

          This can take the values: 'Diverse', 'Focused', 'No Segment', where 'No Segment' refers to a customer who has only made a single order with us.

          This allocation is as follows:
            - First we calculate the total unique products this customer has ordered from us
            - Then we calculate the amount of time between their first and last order with us and divide their total number of unique products ordered by this, giving us an average new product bought per unit time
            - Lastly, analysis of the distibution of average new product bought per unit time is carried out, and from there the customer is allocated into a segment accordingly.
        tests:
          - accepted_values:
              values: ['Diverse', 'Focused', 'No Segment']
